                        <h3>The Journey of Learning</h3>
                        <p>Education has always been more than collecting credentials for me. It's been about transformation.</p>
                        
                        <p>In Seoul, I learned to see the world through design. Every subway map, every street sign, every interface became a lesson in communication. My professors taught me that design isn't about making things pretty. It's about making complex things clear.</p>
                        
                        <p>My exchange at MICA in Baltimore shifted everything. For the first time, I was the outsider, struggling to express ideas in a second language, learning to design for users who saw the world differently than I did. That discomfort became my greatest teacher.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now at Michigan, I'm learning that research is an act of empathy. Every interview, every usability test is a chance to understand someone's struggle and design a better path forward. This isn't just graduate school. It's where everything I've learned comes together.</p>

                        <p>Between the lines of my transcript are late nights in the studio, conversations that changed how I think, and the slow realization that I want to spend my life making technology more human.</p>

                        <h3>What the Resume Doesn't Say</h3>
                        <p>Behind every project metric is a story of failure, learning, and small victories.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>As a research assistant at Michigan</strong>, I'm learning that academic research moves slowly for a reason. Each literature review, each coding session, each weekly meeting teaches me patience and rigor. Reading dozens of papers on LLM validation isn't glamorous, but it's teaching me to think critically about the AI tools we're all rushing to adopt. The work may not be flashy, but it matters.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Leading the Center for Campus Involvement project</strong> taught me that managing people is harder than managing pixels. Coordinating three undergraduate researchers, scheduling interviews with busy staff members, and translating messy qualitative data into clean recommendations required skills they don't teach in design school. That 1,800+ number? Those are real student organizations, real people trying to make campus better.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The 40% conversion increase at Greydient</strong> sounds impressive on paper. What it really represents is hours of watching users struggle with a checkout form, feeling their frustration, and then the quiet satisfaction of designing something that just works. The hardest part wasn't the design. It was convincing stakeholders that sometimes less is more.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>At LG Electronics</strong>, I was terrified. I was the youngest person in the room, proposing air gesture interfaces to senior engineers. But winning first place taught me that good research and solid design thinking can speak louder than years of experience. And mentoring those two designers? That's when I realized I love teaching as much as doing.</p>

                        <p><strong>My military service</strong> might seem unrelated to UX design, but that vehicle dispatch app taught me everything about constraints. I had no budget, minimal development resources, and users who had zero patience for complicated interfaces. When your design has to work for tired soldiers at 3 AM, you learn real fast what "intuitive" actually means. That commendation plaque sits on my desk as a reminder that good design solves real problems for real people.</p>

                        <p>Every project taught me the same lesson: design is an act of service. We're not here to make things beautiful. We're here to make things work for people who have better things to do than figure out our interfaces.</p>

                        <p>Design work is intense. It's hours of pixel-pushing, user testing, and iteration. Travel is my reset button.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Seoul to Baltimore to Ann Arbor.</strong> Each city taught me a different design language. Seoul's subway system is a masterclass in information hierarchy. Baltimore's row houses showed me the beauty of constraints. Ann Arbor's mix of historic and modern taught me that good design respects context.</p>
                        
                        <p>I collect transit maps the way some people collect postcards. Not because I'm obsessed with trains, but because a good transit map is a perfect intersection of function and form. It has to work for tourists and locals, in a hurry and at leisure, in five different languages. That's the kind of design that fascinates me.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>My favorite coffee shops aren't the trendy ones.</strong> They're the ones where the menu makes sense, where you don't have to ask questions, where the space tells you exactly what to do without saying a word. I study these spaces like other designers study Behance.</p>
                        
                        <p>I take walks without my phone. It's the only way I can really see a place. The patterns of wear on a staircase, the improvised solutions people create for everyday problems, the way light changes throughout the day. These aren't hobbies. They're research in disguise.</p>

                        <p><strong>Late at night, when I can't sleep</strong>, I redesign things in my head. The coffee shop menu. The parking garage signage. The voting ballot. Not because I think I'm smarter than whoever designed them, but because it's how I make sense of the world.</p>

                        <p>Some people meditate. I design.</p>
