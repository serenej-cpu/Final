                    After failing early admissions and getting accepted through regular admissions after various ups and downs, I was admitted to Hongik University. Because I hadn't determined a clear career path in high school, I entered the Free Arts major hoping to take various department courses. It was a time of much contemplation about what I should do. At the same time, with the mindset of trying many things, I ended up becoming the class representative.

                    I remember 2018 as a year when I traveled a lot. Whenever I had the opportunity, I saved money and traveled during breaks. I went to Cuba because I was fascinated by a newspaper article saying there would be a transfer of power through a referendum in a socialist country, and while I was at it, I visited New York too. For Mongolia, I gathered friends to see the desert and stars. I went to Thailand to skydive and scuba dive before enlisting in the military. I took a lot of photos, which I used for assignments and sold to fund my next trips. Still, it wasn't much, so I lived broke for a while after enlisting. Oh, around the time I became a private first class, I saved up my salary and briefly visited Japan too.

                    </div>
                    I prepared for an exchange student program during the latter part of my military service. It required an enormous amount of time and effort to proceed in such a limited environment. I was discharged in July 2020 and was scheduled to depart in August, but it was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak that spring, and I took a leave of absence. I think it was during this time that the injustices I witnessed while traveling and the experience of isolation from being unable to leave the country due to COVID came together, and I began contemplating "design that provides opportunities." The answer I found at the time was a method based on design thinking that could help users overcome systemic and environmental limitations, and I started studying with that conclusion.

                    With friends, I pursued a project called [WYSIWYG] based on the "design that provides opportunities" I had been studying. It was truly precious and meaningful time for me, and perhaps because of that, I was accepted to my second (canceled) and third exchange student applications, eventually studying at the Maryland Institute College of Art in the U.S. It was an enjoyable time meeting many good people and learning a lot. Perhaps because my story was interesting, I was invited by the host school's department chair to give a brief presentation at the regular board meeting. After the exchange semester ended, I traveled to New York, Washington, and Japan before returning to Korea. I'm currently learning service design and speculative design at Hongik University. The classes are fun, but I secretly regret refusing the intern offers I received while in the U.S., thinking I needed to graduate.
